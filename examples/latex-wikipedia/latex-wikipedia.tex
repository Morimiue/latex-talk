\maketitle
\LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for
the \TeX{} typesetting program. It offers
programmable desktop publishing features and
extensive facilities for automating most
aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing,
including numbering and  cross-referencing,
tables and figures, page layout,
bibliographies, and much more. \LaTeX{} was
originally written in 1984 by Leslie Lamport
and has become the  dominant method for using
\TeX; few people write in plain \TeX{} anymore.
The current version is \LaTeXe.
